# ArangoDB

ArangoDB is a multi-model, open-source database with flexible data models for
documents, graphs, and key-values. Build high performance applications using a
convenient SQL-like query language or JavaScript extensions. Use ACID
transactions if you require them. Scale horizontally and vertically with a few
mouse clicks.
The supported data models can be mixed in queries and allow ArangoDB to be the 
aggregation point for your data.
To get started, try one of our 10 Minutes Tutorials in your favorite
programming language or try one of our [ArangoDB Cookbook recipes](https://docs.arangodb.com/cookbook).
For the impatient: [download and install ArangoDB](https://www.arangodb.com/download. Then start the server arangod and
point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8529/.

## Key Features in ArangoDB

* Multi-Model Documents, graphs and key-value pairs: model your data as you
see fit for your application
* Joins: Conveniently join what belongs together for flexible ad-hoc querying,
less data redundancy
*Transactions: Easy application development keeping your data consistent and
safe. No hassle in your client

Joins and Transactions are key features for flexible, secure data designs,
widely used in RDBMSs that you wonâ€™t want to miss in NoSQL products. You
decide how and when to use Joins and strong consistency guarantees, keeping all
the power for scaling and performance as choice.
Furthermore, ArangoDB offers a microservice framework called Foxx to build your
own Rest API with a few lines of code.

## Key features include:

* Schema-free schemata let you combine the space efficiency of MySQL with the
  performance power of NoSQL
* Use a data-centric microservices approach with ArangoDB Foxx and fuse your
  application-logic and database together for maximal throughput
* JavaScript for all: no language zoo, you can use one language from your
  browser to your back-end
* ArangoDB is multi-threaded - exploit the power of all your cores
* Flexible data modeling: model your data as combination of key-value pairs,
  documents or graphs - perfect for social relations
* Free index choice: use the correct index for your problem, be it a skip list
  or a fulltext search
* Configurable durability: let the application decide if it needs more
  durability or more performance
* No-nonsense storage: ArangoDB uses all of the power of modern storage
  hardware, like SSD and large caches
* Powerful query language (AQL) to retrieve and modify data
* Transactions: run queries on multiple documents or collections with optional
  transactional consistency and isolation
* Replication and Sharding: set up the database in a master-slave configuration
  or spread bigger datasets across multiple servers
* It is open source (Apache Licence 2.0)
